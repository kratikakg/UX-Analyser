# UX Analyser 
This project, UX Analyzer, is a tool built with Python to evaluate and improve how user-friendly a website is. It analyzes different parts of a webpage, like its structure, accessibility, and design, to give useful feedback on how well the website follows good UX practices.

The tool checks things like whether headings are organized correctly, if images have descriptive text (alt text), and if there are any broken links. It also looks at how readable the text is, whether the site is mobile-friendly, and if it loads quickly. For modern websites that use JavaScript to load content, the tool uses Selenium to handle and analyze those pages too.

After the analysis, the tool creates a report with a score for the website's user experience and detailed suggestions to improve specific areas. This makes it easy for developers, designers, and businesses to understand whatâ€™s working well and what needs improvement.

In short, this project helps websites become more user-friendly, accessible, and effective in delivering a great experience to visitors.
